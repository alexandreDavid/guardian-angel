Let's think about a new way to access to a platform. Instead of giving your personal information to a company you don't know / trust, it is the contrary way. You give the permission to this instance to access a certain type of your data.

What are the pros ? No more lost or stolen personal information in the nature.

In term of communication, it can be interested to stop giving an email and to only receive notification in a centralised UI which permits to manage it easily and for all the accounts.

But, it is a loss of benefice for the targeted platform. They can't sell anymore your data. Is it really something that should exists in our world ? No !

Bye web2 welcome to a new world.
